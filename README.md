# PanelSelect
Sublime plugin to select and focus on a given panel.

This plugin is meant to help manage 3 panels in a sublime workspace. It will resize the two panels you are not focusing on and set your cursor in the selected panel. 

I expanding the plugin to:
1. work dynamically with any given number of panels
2. add a panel when you try to focus on a panel that does not exist
3. override the 'ctrl+number' key bindings
4. provide settings for how small to make the panels
